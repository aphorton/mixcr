MiXCR Immune Repertoire Analyzer @ BaseSpaceÂ®
=============================================

If your data is deposited at the BaseSpace cloud platform you can perform repertoire extraction and calculate common analysis metrics like V/J usage, without leaving BaseSpace, with the use of MiXCR Immune Repertoire Analyzer app (this `link <https://basespace.illumina.com/apps/5538533/MiXCR-Immune-Repertoire-Analyzer>`_ works if you are logged in into base space, and `this one <https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/informatics-products/basespace-sequence-hub/apps/milaboratory-mixcr-immune-repertoire-analyzer.html>`_ points to the overview page available without authentication).

Input
-----

MiXCR Immune Repertoire Analyzer has minimal possible set of parameters to still make it applicable for the most part of sequencing data types TCR/IG repertoires can be extracted from.

The list of possible sequencing material sources include, but is not limited to:

  - all targeted TCR and IG profiling protocols (both RNA- and gDNA-derived, including multiplex-PCR and 5'RACE based techniques)
  - non-enriched RNA-Seq data
  - WGS
  - single-cell data
